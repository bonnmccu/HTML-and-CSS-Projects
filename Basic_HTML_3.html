	<h3>Ode to the Fish</h3>

<h4><i>A Sonnet by - A Random Poem Generator</i></h4>

<p>My pretty fish, you inspire me to write.
I love the way you frighten, swim and glide,
Invading my mind day and through the night,
Always dreaming about the quiet tide.
How do I love you? Let me count the ways.
I love your vernal colors, eyes and fins.
Thinking of your glossy eyes fills my days.
My love for you is the accusing waves. Now I must away with a nitty heart. Remember my through words whilst we're apart.</p>
